## Week 2
> The python community actively maintains an interactive self paced python programming walkthrough. The material is actively updated and provides a progressively more difficult training. They sourced the idea from the ruby community. The ruby community built up the iterative practice idea from a zen concept named *koan*. The python koans are the focus of this week. First you'll need to configure your environment for the koans. Then you'll get to solve the first several koans. Continue to the lectures.

Koans from the man who wrote them, Greg. [python_koans seminar - youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M64aoqgVsMM)

In this week get the koans started. If you complete `koans/about_asserts.py` that will be enough until week 3. The final test in about asserts involves understanding an object oriented type concept. Its a bit tricky to pass, but fortunately Greg went into better detail [here]( http://bit.ly/__class__).
