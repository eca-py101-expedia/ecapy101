## Week 2
> The python community actively maintains an interactive self paced python programming walkthrough. The material is actively updated and provides a progressively more difficult training. They sourced the idea from the ruby community. The ruby community built up the iterative practice idea from a zen concept named *koan*. The python koans are the focus of this week. First you'll need to configure your environment for the koans. Then you'll get to solve the first several koans. Continue to the lectures.
