## Week 4
#### of the :wolf:

> Congrats on making the halfway point! You entered this class curious about programming. Regardless of your background by now you've taken the first step into a new alternate computer universe. You're in the driver seat and you get to decide what the computer is going to do for you. When I stare at a blank canvas with a paint brush in my hand I feel a bit intimidated, and I think its ok to feel that way about programming at this stage. Whether this is an audit-tour of programming or a potential future for you, enjoy it. 

> In week 4, we are going to put all the lessons and tools to good use writing our first program.
